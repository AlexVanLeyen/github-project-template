# github-project-template

This template project contains common meta resources I use in my Github projects. 

In this template, you will find:
* A template for pull requests.
* A workflow for standardizing pull request titles.

This project was intentionally created for the purposes of education and ease of use.
Please feel free to use and modify these templates in your projects.
